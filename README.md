## **Act Like a Planner**
The Act Like a Planner repository is a small utility that seeks to help planners learn to use generative AI to augment their planning practice. This Github Pages allows urban planners to query and construct their own ChatGPT prompts from a database of user-submitted prompts.



### **Features**

* **Prompt Submission:** Planners can submit ChatGPT prompts through a Google Form. The form can be accessed [here](https://forms.gle/2ErPJU3nyEZegnBM6). Users only need general knowledge of ChatGPT in order to submit a prompt.  The board will review prompt submissions and may make minor modifications in order to incorporate them into the database.  Participants can opt-in to receive attribution for their contributions.
  
* **Prompt Querying:** The [Act Like a Planner page](/like-a-planner.html) allows users to search through and query the list of existing prompts. It also allows users to construct their own prompts.



### **Usage**

Access the prompt submission form [here](https://forms.gle/2ErPJU3nyEZegnBM6) to submit your own ChatGPT prompt. 

You can also visit the main site [here](/like-a-planner.html) to search through the list of existing prompts and construct your own.
